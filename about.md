I will be joining as grad student at [ETH Zurich](https://www.ethz.ch/en.html) where I would be pursuing Master in Computer Science.
I recently graduated from [Indian Institute of Technology Jodhpur](http://iitj.ac.in) completing  my B.Tech in Computer Science and Engineering. My research interest are towards Systems and Security. 

Currently, I am working as a researcher at [CyLab Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cylab.cmu.edu/index.html) under [Dr. Lujo Bauer](https://www.cylab.cmu.edu/education/faculty/bauer.html) and [Dr. Limin Jia](http://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/liminjia/) on Information Flow Control for Chromium Browser

I was a research intern at [Max Planck Institute for Software Systems Saarbrucken Germany](https://mpi-sws.org/) under [Prof. Deepak Garg](https://mpi-sws.org/~dg/) worked closely with [Vineet Rajani](http://www.mpi-sws.org/~vrajani/) and [Abhishek Bichhawat](http://csl.cs.uni-saarland.de/people/bichhawat/) on Information Flows for JavaScript and Browser Clients.

I also did a research intern at [Indian Institute of Technology Guwahati](http://www.iitgn.ac.in/) under [Prof. Rajen K. Sinha](http://www.iitg.ac.in/maths/people/faclist.php?id=rajen) worked closley with [Dr. G. Murali Mohan Reddy](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Murali_Reddy3) on Finite Element Method for Parabolic Interface Problem. 

I love contributing to the open source community. Majorly I contribute in various projects by Mozilla community like Firefox Browser and Servo (New Javascript engine that is being written in Rust), ssh_scan (A SSH configuration and policy scanner) and PaperBadger(Issuing badges to credit authors for their work on academic paper).

I was a part of few of these events listed below:

* [ACM ICPC Asia Regionals](https://icpc.baylor.edu/regionals) 2013
* [Microsoft Build The Shield](http://buildtheshield.microsoft.com/) 2014 and 2015
* [KDE Conf India](https://kde.in/conf/2014) 2014
* [JS Conf India](http://www.jschannel.com/#/) 2013

My CV [PDF](http://jinankjain.github.io/Resume.pdf) last updated on August 2017.
